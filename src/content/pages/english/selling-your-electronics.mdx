eBay charges us a fee for selling on their platform. The amount differs based on item category and final sale value.

### Postage before commission

We tend to include postage into our listings, as this generally results in higher volume and quicker sales. Therefore we deduct this from the sale price before applying our commission.

### How long does it take?

We aim to have enough room to accomodate a large number of items. In many cases it may take a long time to sell your goods. We will endevour to get a good price for you and avoid auction, as this can lead to very disappointing results.
